# Hafnium Verification

Welcome to the Hafnium verification project. Hafnium is an open source project
to build a secure hypervisor that allows system designers to achieve
confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data with fine-grained security
domains. One of the top priorities of Project Oak is to provide higher assurance
of Hafnium's security using formal verification.
